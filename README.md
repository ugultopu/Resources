## Building React From Scratch - Paul O’Shannessy
In [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MAD4Oly9yg) at 2016 React Rally, Paul O’Shannessy walks us through building an MVP React clone, without using any exteral dependencies. The aim is to get a better understanding of how the React library internals works. Paul has later uploaded a copy of the code he presented at the talk to [this repository](https://github.com/zpao/building-react-from-scratch).
